## Testing the Map Visualization Project

<br>
<br>

Testing the Map Visualization Project is done by testing the
response request before the data collection.

<br>
<br>

```
function testReponseIsSuccessful(reponse) {
    if (reponse.ok) {
        console.log("Response for " + reponse.url + " was successful");
        console.log("Repsonse - " + reponse.statusText);


        return reponse.json();
    }
    else {
        console.log("Response for " + reponse.url + " failed");
        console.log("Response - " + reponse.statusText)
        error.innerHTML = '<h2 class="errorMessage"> ERROR: Response ' + reponse.url + ' failed.</h2>';
    }
}
```

<br>
<br>


One can view the success of the response in the console.
